# SMTPDFix: Test email, locally

![build](https://github.com/bebleo/bebleo_smtpd_fixture/workflows/build/badge.svg)

A simple SMTP server based on `aiosmtpd` for use as a fixture with pytest that supports encryption and authentication. All this does is receives messages and appends them to a list as an `email.Message`.

⚠ **Not intended for use with production systems.** ⚠

This fixture is intended to address cases where to test an application that sends an email, it needs to be intercepted for subsequent processing. For example, sending an email with a code for password reset or two-factor authentication. This fixture allows a test to trigger the email being sent, ensure that it's sent, and read the email.

## Installing

To install using pip, first upgrade pip to the latest version to avoid any issues installing `cryptography`:

```bash
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install smtpdfix
```

Or, if you're using setuptools, it can be included in the `extras_require` argument of a `setup.py` file:

```python
setup(
    ...
    extras_require={
        "test": [
            "pytest",
            "smtpdfix",
        ],
    },
)
```

and then installed with pip (-e assumes that you want your project to be editable):

```bash
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install -e .[test]
```

## Using

The `SMTPDFix` plugin, `smtpd`, automatically registers for use with pytest when you install smtpdfix. To use it simply add to your test method.

```python
from smtplib import SMTP


def test_sendmail(smtpd):
    from_addr = "from.addr@example.org"
    to_addrs = "to.addr@example.org"
    msg = (f"From: {from_addr}\r\n"
           f"To: {to_addrs}\r\n"
           f"Subject: Foo\r\n\r\n"
           f"Foo bar")

    with SMTP(smtpd.hostname, smtpd.port) as client:
        client.sendmail(from_addr, to_addrs, msg)

    assert len(smtpd.messages) == 1
```

To use STARTTLS:

```python
from smtplib import SMTP


def test_sendmail(smtpd):
    smptd.config.use_starttls = True
    from_ = "from.addr@example.org"
    to_ = "to.addr@example.org"
    msg = (f"From: {from_}\r\n"
           f"To: {to_}\r\n"
           f"Subject: Foo\r\n\r\n"
           f"Foo bar")

    with SMTP(smtpd.hostname, smtpd.port) as client:
        client.starttls()  # Note that you need to call starttls first.
        client.sendmail(from_addr, to_addrs, msg)

    assert len(smtpd.messages) == 1
```

> As of version 0.2.7 the plugin automatically registers and it is not necessary to include it manually by adding `pytest_plugins = "smtpdfix"` to the module or conftest.py.

The certificates included with the fixture will work for addresses localhost, localhost.localdomain, 127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.1, ::1. If using other addresses the key (key.pem) and certificate (cert.pem) must be in a location specified under `SMTP_SSL_CERTS_PATH`.

### Not as a fixture

In some situations it may be desirable to not use the fixture which is initialized before entering the test. This can be accomplished by using the `SMTPDFix` class.

```python
from smtplib import SMTP

from smtpdfix import SMTPDFix


def test_smtpdfix():
    hostname, port = "127.0.0.1", 8025

    with SMTPDFix(hostname, port) as smtpd:
        with SMTP(hostname, port) as client:
            from_addr = "foo@example.org"
            to_addrs = "bar@example.org"
            msg = (f"From: {from_addr}\r\n"
                   f"To: {to_addrs}\r\n"
                   f"Subject: Foo\r\n\r\n"
                   f"Foo bar")

            client.sendmail(from_addr, to_addrs, msg)

        assert len(smtpd.messages) == 1
```

### Configuration

Configuration is handled through properties in the `config` of the fixture and are initially set from environment variables:

Property         | Variable               | Default              | Description
-----------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------
`host`           | `SMTPD_HOST`           | `127.0.0.1` or `::1` | The hostname that the fixture will listen on.
`port`           | `SMTPD_PORT`           | `8025`               | The port that the fixture will listen on.
`ready_timeout`  | `SMTPD_READY_TIMEOUT`  | `10.0`               | The seconds the server will wait to start before raising a `TimeoutError`.
`login_username` | `SMTPD_LOGIN_NAME`     | `user`               | Username for default authentication.
`login_password` | `SMTPD_LOGIN_PASSWORD` | `password`           | Password for default authentication.
`use_ssl`        | `SMTPD_USE_SSL`        | `False`              | Whether the fixture should use fixed TLS/SSL for transactions. If using smtplib requires that `SMTP_SSL` be used instead of `SMTP`.
`use_starttls`   | `SMTPD_USE_STARTTLS`   | `False`              | Whether the fixture should use StartTLS to encrypt the connections. If using `smtplib` requires that `SMTP.starttls()` is called before other commands are issued. Overrides `use_tls` as the preferred method for securing communications with the client.
`enforce_auth`   | `SMTPD_ENFORCE_AUTH`   | `False`              | If set to true then the fixture refuses MAIL, RCPT, DATA commands until authentication is completed.
`ssl_cert_path`  | `SMTPD_SSL_CERTS_PATH` | `./certs/`           | The path to the key and certificate in PEM format for encryption with SSL/TLS or StartTLS.
`ssl_cert_files` | `SMTPD_SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SMTPD_SSL_KEY_FILE` | `("cert.pem", None)` | A tuple of the path for the certificate file and key file in PEM format. See [Resolving certificate and key paths](#resolving-certificate-and-key-paths) for more details.

> If environment variables are included in a `.env` file they'll be loaded automatically.

### Resolving certificate and key paths

In order to resolve the certificate and key paths for the SSL/TLS context SMTPDFix does the following:

1. On initialization of a `smtpdfix.Config` the `ssl_cert_path` is set by the `SMTPD_SSL_CERTS_PATH` environment variable and the `ssl_cert_files` is set to a tuple of `(SMTPD_SSL_CERT_FILE and SMTPD_SSL_KEY_FILE)`. If the environment variables are not set the deafults are used.
2. If an SSL Context is needed, when the `smptdfix.AuthController` is initialized it will attempt to find the files in the following sequence for both the certificate file and the key file:
   1. If the value in `ssl_cert_files` is `None` then `None` is returned. Setting the key file to be none assumes that it has been included in the certificate file.
   2. If the value in `ssl_cert_files` is a valid path to a file then this is returned.
   3. `ssl_cert_path` and the value from `ssl_cert_files` are joined and returned if it a valid path to a file.
   4. A `FileNotFoundError` is raised.

An example, assuming that the certificate and key are written in a single PEM file located at `./certificates/localhost.cert.pem` would be:

```python
from smtplib import STMP_SSL


def test_custom_certificate(smtpd):
    smtpd.config.ssl_cert_files = "./certificates/localhost.cert.pem"
    smtpd.config.use_ssl = True

    from_ = "from.addr@example.org"
    to_ = "to.addr@example.org"
    msg = (f"From: {from_}\r\n"
           f"To: {to_}\r\n"
           f"Subject: Foo\r\n\r\n"
           f"Foo bar")

    with SMTP_SSL(smtpd.hostname, smtpd.port) as client:
        client.sendmail(from_addr, to_addrs, msg)

    assert len(smtpd.messages) == 1
```

## Alternatives

Many libraries for sending email have built-in methods for testing and using these methods should generally be prefered over SMTPDFix. Some known solutions:

+ **fastapi-mail**: has a `record_messsages()` method to intercept the mail. Instructions on how to suppress the sending of mail and implement it can be seen at [https://sabuhish.github.io/fastapi-mail/example/#unittests-using-fastapimail](https://sabuhish.github.io/fastapi-mail/example/#unittests-using-fastapimail)
+ **flask-mail**: has a method to suppress sending and capture the email for testing purposes. [Instructions](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/#unit-tests-and-suppressing-emails)

## Developing

To develop and test smtpdfix you will need to install [pytest-asyncio](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio) to run asynchronous tests, [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) to sort imports and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to lint. To install in a virtual environment for development:

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ ./venv/scripts/activate
$ pip install -e .[dev]
```

Code is tested using tox:

```bash
$ tox
```

Quick tests can be handled by running pytest directly:

```bash
$ pytest -p no:smtpd --cov
```

Before submitting a pull request with your changes you should ensure that all imports are sorted and that the code passes linting with flake8.

```bash
$ isort .
$ flake8 .
```

We include a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration file to automate checks and clean up imports before pushing code. In order to install pre-commit git hooks:

```bash
$ pip install pre-commit
$ pre-commit install
```

## Known Issues

+ Firewalls may interfere with the operation of the smtp server.
+ Authenticating with LOGIN and PLAIN mechanisms fails over TLS/SSL, but works with STARTTLS. [Issue #10](https://github.com/bebleo/smtpdfix/issues/10)
+ Currently no support for termination through signals. [Issue #4](https://github.com/bebleo/smtpdfix/issues/4)
+ If the fixture start exceeds the `ready_timeout` and aborts the host and port are not consistently released and subsequent uses may result in an error. [Issue #80](https://github.com/bebleo/smtpdfix/issues/80)
